# bulk_clot_contraction
Standalone application to analyze bulk clot contraction assay data

The Lam lab/Myers lab bulk clot contraction assay analyzes time series images of bulk platelet clots contracting over time (see two sample images). Users select a region of interest describing (first) a reference measurement area and (subsequent) one or more rectangular/square clots. From the reference area and clot areas, volume of clot over time is calculated. Outputs are provided as numerical .xlsx data and graphical .png files (see sample outputs).

My contribution: sole developer of standalone application.

Standalone version v0.1.0 is available upon request, please email me at meredith.e.fay@gmail.com for files for Mac (.app) or Windows OS (.exe) and associated test data. Experimental methods available upon request. This standalone application will eventually be expanded upon and published as part of a platelet assay analysis toolkit.
